# MFAT ðŸ§˜
MFAT â€” My Friend and Teacher is a free & open-source (FOSS) application, designed to make learning more entertaining and effective.

It was created out of a struggle to prepare for our final exams properly while getting feedback on our performance and hints about where we could improve, without totally hoging all of the schools/teachers resources.

In simple terms this program lets you take training drills and generates detailed statistics about your performance.

IMPORTANT â€” THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN A VERY EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE LET US KNOW ABOUT ANY BUGS OR FEATURES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED IN THE ('ISSUES')[https://github.com/jojo-calabra/mfat/issues] PAGE.

The core principles for the applied learning methods are:
- Visual clues
- Multimedia Approach
- ICT Enabled Learning / Digital Learning
- Spaced Repetition Learning
- Reward discovery / Reinforcement Learning
