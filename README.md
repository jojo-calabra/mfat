# MFAT ðŸ§˜

MFAT â€” My Friend and Teacher is a free & open-source (FOSS) application, designed to make learning more entertaining and effective.

It was created out of a struggle to prepare for our final exams properly while getting feedback on our performance and hints about where we could improve, without totally hoging all of the schools/teachers resources.

In simple terms this program lets you take training drills and generates detailed statistics about your performance.

# Core Principles

The core principles for the applied learning methods are:
- Learning by doing
- Problem Solving / Pattern Recognition
- Collaborative and cooperative learning
- Selection of subject content based on individual performance history
- Digital Learning (or ICT Enabled Learning) / Multimedia Approach & Visual clues
- Spaced Repetition Learning
- Reward discovery / Reinforcement Learning
- Memory Learning / Memorizing

We want to help our classmates learn better and give them the feeling of being rewarded and appreciated for investing time to learn.
We noticed that our classes grades strongly depend on student motivation and wether or not we were given opportunities to apply the lessons learned to a problem.
